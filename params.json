From this class I have taken away many skills that I believe could be beneficial to your working environment.\r\n\r\nTo begin, this was my first cyber security course, although definitely not my first computer science course, but as such I was looking for challenge, so all assignments for this course have been completed solo. That said, some of the assignments done did have collaboration with multiple peers at times.\r\n\r\nI'll begin with the actual assignments.\r\n\r\n##Markovian Tweet Generator \r\n[Project 1](https://cpeg-project-1-drakemattsmith.c9users.io)  \r\nThe objective of this assignment was to consume a text file with sentences and produce a tweet (< 145 characters) with the style of the input text. This project began my journey into secure software as well as providing me with stronger I/O control.\r\n\r\n##Polynomial Addition \r\n[Project 2](https://cpeg-project-2-drakemattsmith.c9users.io)  \r\nFor this assignment I was tasked with creating a program that takes in two polynomials of various degrees and adds them then outputs the result while following as many CERT standard MEM and STR rules as possible. From this I had gained better memory management skills and increased my cyber security knowledge.\r\n\r\n##Command Line Minesweeper \r\n[Project 3](https://cpeg-proj3-drakemattsmith.c9users.io)  \r\nLastly, I was tasked with creating a command line based minesweeper game while following as many CERT standard ARR and EXP rules as possible. This project, at least for me, wasn't about the security aspect. It was during this project that I realized I was passionate about coding, but not cyber security. Creating the game was exciting, it gave me the rush that coding always does. But when it came to going through and scouting my code for leaks, I found the task tedious and rather boring. That being said, obviously the assignment was an assignment so it was completed, as asked, although it shed light on something.\r\n\r\n##What this course has really taught me:\r\n\r\nI am skilled in the craft of coding, and I love doing it. There is no joy for me quite like finishing a program after hours of struggling with it, no matter how much I didn't like the project to begin with. So cyber security may not be my path, or at least nothing that has to do with checking code. But I am an avid programmer and will continue to grow my abilities. From this class I may not take away what was expected, but I did learn where my passions are, I did learn more of my strengths and weaknesses. As for course related skills, I learned how to better my code through various testing and debugging styles and tools, and I learned many of the CERT standards. I learned about cryptography. I gained skill in I/O, memory management, database skills, the ability to create and manage websites, and a greater understanding of C and C++ as a whole.\r\n\r\nMost importantly this class, and the professor, taught me that being told what to do and doing it well doesn't make you an asset. What makes someone a better worker and a happier person is taking charge in life and at work. I learned that initiative and creativity can well outlast skill.\r\n\r\nThis class has taught me not only useful skills for coding but what it truly takes to be the kind of person that succeeds in this, and any, business, and the kind of person that takes life and really grabs it, not just sits along for the ride.",
